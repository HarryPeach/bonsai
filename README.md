> bonsai is a todo app with an 'agile' style of task management

## about

bonsai is loosely based on agile task management methods.

any tasks you add to bonsai will be added to the backlog, if they have a date assigned then this will be shown and will appear as a highlighted task on the required date.

you can enable daily notifications to remind you of your tasks for the day, backlog tasks, and any other important-marked tasks

## installation

APKs are not yet available until there is a stable release, you can build from source though by installing flutter and running `flutter run`
